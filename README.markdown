# Interacting Hierarchical Dynamic Networks (IHDNs)

This work has been published in the 2018 Artificial Life conference (Tokyo). The full paper can be found here.

An original graph-based model of computation for the simulation of interacting, dynamic, multi-scale systems. Computation of IHDNs employs the use of a novel message passing mechanism that operates across layers of abstraction in hierachical dynamic networks to capture the complex dependencies of living (or other naturally occuring) systems.

An example simulation modelling the evolution of cancer cells in aneuploid tumour growth is included, see [SimImpl.java](src/main/java/demo/SimImpl.java).
